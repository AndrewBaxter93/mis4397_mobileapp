<!--Write in the steps-->

<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">1.) The bulbs for all of your red, white and yellow lights are hidden behind a colored lens.  First you need to remove the lens housing from the car. It's usually held in place with a few Phillips-head screws.</a></li>
  <li class="list-group-item">2.) Now that you have the screws out and safely stowed you can pull the entire bulb assembly, or housing, out of its hole. Most assemblies will pull out as a whole, but some have a removable outer cover.</a></li>
  <li class="list-group-item">3.) The bulbs in your brake light or tail light assembly are held in place using a plug that holds the bulb that also screws into the light assembly. Follow the wires to the back of the light that you need to replace. It only takes a quarter turn or so to unseat it and pull it out.</a></li>
  <li class="list-group-item">4.) Finally! You can see the light (or lack thereof) at the end of the tunnel, a dead bulb. Your bulb either pulls straight out (most do these days) or requires a quarter turn twist like the bulb holder did. Remove the bad bulb and put the new one in.</a></li>
