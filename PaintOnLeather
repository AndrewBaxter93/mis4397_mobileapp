<!--Write in the steps-->

<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">1.) Moisten the paint by adding a small amount of water directly to the paint surface. Allow the water to set for 5 minutes, and then blot with a clean cloth.</a></li>
  <li class="list-group-item">2.) Apply a clay bar to the paint. Gently rub the clay bar over the surface of the paint, using a simple clockwise motion. Use a cloth to blot the area, and then repeat 2 to 3 times, incrementally removing more of the paint.</a></li>
  <li class="list-group-item"></a>3.) Use a mild detergent mixture. Combine 2 parts dishwashing detergent with 1 part water. Then soak a clean cloth in the combination. Lay the cloth directly over the paint stain, and allow it to remain in place for 5 minutes. Gently rub and then blot the area to remove additional paint.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item"></a>4.) Scrape lightly with a razor blade. Gently use the blade to scrape across the painted area at an angle. Blot with a moistened cloth. Then scrape the surface a second time.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item"></a>5.) Rub in some olive oil. The oil will permeate the loosened surface of the paint and hopefully make it possible to remove the remainder of the stain. Apply repeatedly as necessary, taking care to blot between applications to remove any paint that the olive oil has dislodged.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item"></a>6.) Treat the newly exposed leather. Buy a professional leather product from an auto supply store, and apply to the area.</li>
</ul>
