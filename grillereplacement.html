<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">1.) Remove the jack bar above the radiator</a></li>
  <li class="list-group-item">2.) Remove the screws (They are plastic so I would use a hand screwdriver and not power) from the plastic radiator cover</a></li>
  <li class="list-group-item">3.) Remove the corner parking lights. They are held on by one star screw from inside the hood. A small flat head could be used if you don't have the right tools.</a></li>
  <li class="list-group-item">4.) Remove all the screws that hold on the Grille surround body part. Most are on top under the plastic radiator cover you removed and two are behind the corner lights you removed.</a></li>
  <li class="list-group-item">5.) Now here is the biggest pain. Under the Grille surround you have a plastic shroud that's held on by plastic pins that go in easy, but not out easy. I used a flat head screwdriver and removed the two from the sides that attach to the fender. The pins may get a little messed up but I was able to reuse mine.</a></li>
  <li class="list-group-item">6.) On the bottom of the grille surround somewhere in the middle you will see two long pieces connecting the bottom of the grille surround to a part of the frame. It's held on by a clip you should be able to squeeze to release.</a></li>
  <li class="list-group-item">7.) Now you should be able to remove the whole grille surround with grille included.</a></li>
  <li class="list-group-item">8.) I first added some lube to the plastic clips that hold the grille on. I then used a flat head screwdriver to pry the clips open. Be careful since the clips can break if you pry too hard</a></li>
  <li class="list-group-item">9.) Once it's remove you need to remove the FORD oval and put in on the new grille (Note: Mine came with an oval, so I skipped this step).</a></li>
  <li class="list-group-item">10.) I then added more lube to the new grille piece so it's easy to install back on the grille surround.</a></li>
  <li class="list-group-item">11.) Double check to make sure all clips are snug before putting the grille surround back on the truck. Don't what to take it off again.</a></li>
  <li class="list-group-item">12.) Put back all parts in reverse order.</a></li>
